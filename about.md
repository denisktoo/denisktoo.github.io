## About

I’m a backend developer with a strong foundation in C#, .NET, and Python. I enjoy building scalable APIs and data-driven solutions that solve real-world problems. During my internship at Leizam Ventures, I contributed to full stack projects using ASP.NET, KnockoutJS, and SQL.

I’m passionate about clean architecture, automation, and using tech to improve systems that impact communities. Always learning, always building.
